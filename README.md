# Wisp
* Wisp is a stateful coverage-based greybox fuzzer based on AFLNET and some mechanisms in SnapFuzz. 
* Wisp checks time cost in different fuzzing stages by profiling the AFLNET fuzzer and uses multiple mechanisms to improve fuzzing throughput, including shared memory-based socket replacement, extra control socket, and dynamic affinity.
* This fuzzer name comes from my favorite warframe [Wisp](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Wisp), which has abilities to share buff with allies and increase speed.

## How to build
### Prequisites
Prepare socket shared library.
```
git clone https://github.com/John6090212/socket_hook.git
cd socket_hook
make
```
### Wisp
Please reference the installation guide in [AFLNET](https://github.com/aflnet/aflnet#installation-tested-on-ubuntu-1804--1604-64-bit).

## Usage
* Now only support testing Dnsmasq(v2.73rc6), TinyDTLS(06995d4) and Dcmqrscp(7f8564c).
* Can run AFLNET with the same command as AFLNET.
* Wisp environment variable:
    * **SERVER**: indicates testing server, options include `DNSMASQ`,`TINYDTLS` and `DCMQRSCP`.
    * **AFL_PRELOAD**: specify path of [socket shared library](https://github.com/John6090212/socket_hook).
    * **USE_AFLNET_SHARE**: set to `1` to enable Wisp. If you want to use AFLNET, just omit these environment variables and use the same command as AFLNET.
* Example command:
```
SERVER=DNSMASQ AFL_PRELOAD=<socket_hook.so path> USE_AFLNET_SHARE=1 afl-fuzz -m none -d -i <input directory> -o <output directory> -N tcp://127.0.0.1/5353 -P DNS -D 10000 -K -R ./dnsmasq
```
